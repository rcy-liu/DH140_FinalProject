# An Analysis Taylor Swiftâ€™s Reputation Album

### Description
Taylor Swift has long been known for her catchy choruses, motivational lyrics, and upbeat music. Her fans can often feel quite deep emotional connections to the lyrics of her songs as she easily creates relatable themes of basic rom-com plot, demonstrates the feeling of being "different", or even create a sense of "slay" energy. As such, while it is commonly known by Swifties that the lyrics of songs are powerful in emotion and meaning, it begs questions if the track order of her albums also convey a story-like narrative. Previous investigation of Taylor Swift's work have clearly seen shifting narrative formula as Reputation identifies as more hip hop while folkmore leans more on the country music elements yet studies within these albums have not been examined in depth. With this interest in mind, I hope to explore the question of whether Taylor Swift crafts some semblence of an overarching narrative with her tracks in the Reputation album. To explore the lyrics of each song in the *Reputation* album, I used the Taylor Swift Song Lyrics dataset containing all the lyrics of her albumns on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thespacefreak/taylor-swift-song-lyrics-all-albums).
